# Project Title

Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Getting Started

This is purely HTML, JavaScript implementation of classic arcade game.  Opening the index.html on a browser (Chrome or Safari will make this work)
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

The player can move left, right, up and down

| Player Action             | Key           | Alternative char key  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Move right     | right-arrow | 'd' |
| Move left      | left-arrow      |   'a' |
| Move down | down arrow      |    's' |
| Move up | up arrow      |    'w' |


The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
